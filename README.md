# Fake-news-detection-using-machine-learning

The advent of the world wide web and the speedy adoption of social media platforms brought the drastic way for information circulation that has never been witnessed in human history before. In today’s world with social media platforms, people are creating and sharing more information than ever before, terrifying part is that the number of information being shared is deceptive with no relevance to reality.
It’s far very necessary that the floated information should be real, so that people would be precautious and aware, and won’t make any false steps because of deceptive news.
Fake News detector is designed mainly to distinguish among fake and real information. To detect fake news with the input of dataset format the trained bidirectional neural network and LSTM based deep learning model is used. With the help of keras we get rid from writing complex deep learning algorithms. But alongside the way we still have to make picks related to some of the hyperparameters. The performance of training model can be increased by training the model for more epochs. To prevent possible overfitting It is important to look out for performance on the validation set and also more layers can be better for improvement however additionally tougher to train
